				<h2>Experiences</h2>
				<p>
					I have done 2 internship. One in PardonMyFrench and one in Celio. Both taught me a lot and made me want to work in marketing. Pardon my French is an audiovisual company. I saw photo retouching and video editing, as well as photo and video shoots. In Celio, i saw how a website works and how they publish their ads and develop their services.
